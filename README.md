 Introduction 
In todayâ€™s competitive insurance market, accurately predicting customer responses to policy offers can greatly enhance marketing efficiency, optimize sales strategies, and increase policy uptake. 
This project focuses on developing a predictive model using machine learning to determine the likelihood of customer response to insurance policy offers. 
By leveraging a rich dataset with features like age, gender, driving license status, vehicle age, and annual premium, the project aims to provide insights into customer behavior and preferences. 


The project workflow includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into the data distributions and feature relationships.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features for model readiness.
Model Selection: Evaluating algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to find the best-fit model.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy and interpretability using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.
This predictive model not only aids in better-targeted marketing strategies but also helps the insurance company make data-driven decisions that improve customer engagement and retention.
